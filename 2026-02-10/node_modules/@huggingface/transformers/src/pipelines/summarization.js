 *
 * const summarizer = await pipeline('summarization', 'Xenova/distilbart-cnn-6-6');
 * const text = 'The tower is 324 metres (1,063 ft) tall, about the same height as an 81-storey building, ' +
 *   'and the tallest structure in Paris. Its base is square, measuring 125 metres (410 ft) on each side. ' +
 *   'During its construction, the Eiffel Tower surpassed the Washington Monument to become the tallest ' +
 *   'man-made structure in the world, a title it held for 41 years until the Chrysler Building in New ' +
 *   'York City was finished in 1930. It was the first structure to reach a height of 300 metres. Due to ' +
 *   'the addition of a broadcasting aerial at the top of the tower in 1957, it is now taller than the ' +
 *   'Chrysler Building by 5.2 metres (17 ft). Excluding transmitters, the Eiffel Tower is the second ' +
 *   'tallest free-standing structure in France after the Millau Viaduct.';
 * const output = await summarizer(text, {
